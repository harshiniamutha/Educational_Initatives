# Design-patterns
This repo demonstrates 6 beginner-friendly use cases of software design patterns in Java. The goal is to show how design patterns solve common coding problems by making systems more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

Behavioral Patterns:

1. Chain of Responsibility – handling support requests.
2. Template Method – defining game flow steps.

Creational Patterns:
3. Builder – constructing custom computers.
4. Singleton – ensuring a single shared instance (e.g., logger).

Structural Patterns:
5. Adapter – playing multiple media formats.
6. Decorator – adding features to coffee orders dynamically.
